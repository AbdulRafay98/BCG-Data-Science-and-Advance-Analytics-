# SME Customers Churn Prediction
## Data-Science-and-Advance-Analytics-BCG

A major gas and electricity utility company PowerCo that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.
One of the hypotheses under consideration is that churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivities and that it is possible to predict customers likely to churn using a predictive model. The client also wants to try a discounting strategy, with the head of the SME division suggesting that offering customers at high propensity to churn a 20% discount might be effective.


## Business Understanding & problem Framing
Go deeper on the hypothesis that the churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivities and coming up with thoughts on how to test this hypothesis.

## EDA & Data Cleaning
Build a churn model to understand whether price sensitivity is the largest driver of churn has potential. For develping model performed some exploratory data analysis and data cleaning.

## Feature Engineering
Now having a good understanding of the data and feels confident to use the data to further understand the business problem. Build out features to uncover signals in the data that could inform the churn model.
Based on the data that is available and was cleaned, identified what could be drivers of churn for our client and building those features to later use in your model.

## Modeling & Evaluation
Build churn model(s) to try to predict the churn probability of any customer, taking into account all the explanatory variables have constructed in the feature engineering process.
Evaluate the model, using a holdout set, and with metrics.
Interpret the results and uses them to formulate answers to the client’s hypotheses and questions.

## Insights & Recommendation
Developed an executive summary slide synthesizing all the findings from the project so far.
